### By Erick Cardenas Poire and Michael Murphy
-----------

This repository contains:

- The powerpoint presentations:
	- Introduction to diversity analysis [(File 1).](<https://github.com/carden24/MIC506-Workshop/raw/master/W1_16S_analysis.pptx>)
	- Use of 16S rRNA as phylogenetic marker in diversity studies [(File 2).](<https://github.com/carden24/MIC506-Workshop/raw/master/W2_16S_analysis.pptx>)
	- Mothur tutorial using the Miseq SOP [(File 3).](<https://github.com/carden24/MIC506-Workshop/raw/master/W3_16S_analysis.pptx>)
  
  
- The Miseq tutorial is based on the mothur Miseq:
	- We will run a modified version of the Miseq tutorial. The guide is [here](<https://github.com/carden24/MIC506-Workshop/blob/master/Miseq_SOP_tutorial.md>).  
	  The main difference is that we will not run a phylotype analysis and use fewer samples to make it run faster.  
	  The original Miseq SOP is available [here](<http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP>)_.   
	- You need a computer with Mothur installed. Installers are available [here](<http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Download_mothur>)_.
	- The Silva-based bacterial reference alignment is [here.](<http://www.mothur.org/w/images/9/98/Silva.bacteria.zip>)
	- Mothur-formatted version of the RDP training set v.9 is [here](<http://www.mothur.org/w/images/5/59/Trainset9_032012.pds.zip>)_.
	- The data files required are [here](https://github.com/carden24/MIC506-Workshop/tree/master/MiSeq_SOP_files).
  
- Other resources:
	- Tree diversity analysis book by Roeland Kindt and Richard Coe.  
	  A nice introduction to diversity analysis. Is also includes detailed R code.  
	  Freely available [here.](<http://www.worldagroforestry.org/resources/databases/tree-diversity-analysis>)
	- Multivariate analyses in microbial ecology by Alban Ramette. A minireview freely available [here.](<http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00375.x>)
	- If you are going to be working with 454 data (pyrosequencing), mothur also has a protocol for in [here](<http://www.mothur.org/wiki/454_SOP>)_.
